# MNIST Computer Vision Project

![MNIST Digits](images/mnist_digits.png)

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Computer Vision project on the MNIST dataset. The goal of the project is to build a neural network model to classify handwritten digits (0 through 9) based on the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
- Model training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset.
- Visualizations of model predictions.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. It is widely used for practicing image classification algorithms.

## Model Architecture
The neural network model is implemented using the Keras library and consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and dense layers.

```python
# Example code snippet
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
